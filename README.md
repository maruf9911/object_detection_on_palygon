YOLOv8 Polygon Object Detection and Counting
Overview
This repository contains a YOLOv8-based model for object detection and counting on polygonal regions. The model is trained to identify and count objects within specified polygons, making it suitable for applications such as counting objects within defined areas in surveillance or monitoring scenarios.

Features
Polygon-based Object Detection: The model is designed to work with polygonal regions, allowing users to define custom areas of interest for object detection and counting.

YOLOv8 Architecture: Leveraging the YOLOv8 architecture, the model provides accurate and real-time object detection capabilities.

Object Counting: The model not only detects objects within polygons but also provides a count of the identified objects, facilitating quantitative analysis.

Easy-to-Use Interface: The repository includes user-friendly scripts and examples for utilizing the model with your own data and polygons.
